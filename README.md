# The Microbe Directory V.03

The Microbe Directory (TMD) is a database of microbial features and ecological characteristics. The database was first developed in 2016 as a collective effort to understand the characteristics of microbial species found in metagenomic studies.
The goal of TMD is to have a comprehensive annotation of ecological and phenotypical data available for every microbial species. This annotation process is a collective manual and computational effort from scientist and volunteers around the globe.

TMD aims to:

>* Provide a curated list of microbes from all domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria, Eukarya, and Virus.
>* Compile microbial data from different databases and metagenomic studies into a single one.
>* Give a phenotypic and ecologic description of microbial species given their unique biological features.
>* Annotate the microbiome where taxa have been identified.
>* Make microbial data handy to everyone!
