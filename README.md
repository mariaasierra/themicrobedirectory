<h3>The Microbe Directory (TMD) is a database of microbial features and ecological characteristics. The database was first developed in 2016 as a collective effort to understand the characteristics of microbial species found in metagenomic studies </h3>
        <h3> The goal of TMD is to have a comprehensive annotation of ecological and phenotypical data available for every microbial species. This annotation process is a collective manual and computational effort from scientist and volunteers around the globe.</h3>

<h4><b>TMD aims to:</b></h4>
<h3>Provide a curated list of microbes from all domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria, Eukarya, and Virus.</h3>
<h3>Compile microbial data from different databases and metagenomic studies into a single one.</h3>
<h3>Give a phenotypic and ecologic description of microbial species given their unique biological features.</h3>
<h3>Annotate the microbiome where taxa have been identified.</h3>
<h3>Make microbial data handy to everyone.</h3>
